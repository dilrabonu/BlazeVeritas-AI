# 🔥BlazeVeritas AI — AI-Powered Wildfire Intelligence System

End-to-End Intelligent Platform for Wildfire Detection, Explainability & Response Planning

**BlazeVeritas AI** is an advanced AI system designed to detect, analyze, and explain wildfire events using deep learning, explainable AI (Grad-CAM), and retrieval-augmented reasoning (RAG).
It integrates computer vision, geospatial analytics, and conversational intelligence into a single Streamlit + FastAPI dashboard.

## 🌍 Overview
 Name Meaning — BlazeVeritas AI

The name “BlazeVeritas” comes from two powerful roots:

Blaze — symbolizing wildfire, energy, and the unpredictable forces of nature.

Veritas — Latin for truth or clarity.

Together, BlazeVeritas AI means “Truth within the Blaze.”
It reflects the project’s mission: to bring clarity, transparency, and explainable intelligence into wildfire detection and response — turning chaos into actionable insight through the power of responsible AI.

Wildfires pose catastrophic threats to ecosystems, infrastructure, and human lives.
BlazeVeritas AI bridges science and technology to deliver:

## Models & Explainability
🔹 CNN Baseline

A lightweight convolutional network for rapid inference on small devices.

🔹 ResNet-18

Residual network ensuring deeper feature extraction and stable gradients.

🔹 DenseNet-121

High-accuracy model for detailed spatial reasoning with dense connectivity.

🔹 Grad-CAM Explainability

Provides per-pixel attention heatmaps highlighting why the model detected fire.

Copilot (RAG Assistant)

The BlazeVeritas Copilot combines:

🔎 Chroma Vector Store for semantic retrieval of wildfire documents

💬 OpenAI LLM (GPT-4o mini / gpt-3.5-turbo) for structured action plans

🌦 Contextual Tools — Weather, NDVI, Topography

Example Query

“What are the immediate risks near the detected area?”

Copilot Response:

Situation summary

Confidence & uncertainties

Immediate actions (0–30 min)

Next steps (2–6 hr)

Key risks

Public communication guidelines

Source citations

**Calibration & Reliability**

Implements Temperature Scaling and Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
to ensure probabilistic outputs reflect true model confidence — critical for
real-world emergency decision-making.

**Geospatial Visualization**

Integrates coordinates from predictions (lat, lon)

Future support for NASA FIRMS, Sentinel-2, and Earth Engine data streams

Enables mapping of fire hotspots and uncertainty regions
